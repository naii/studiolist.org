	<p><em>studiolist.org is <a href="https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/">ethical by design</a>, and it’s <a href="https://github.com/naii/studiolist.org">open-source</a> because it stands for trust and transparency. I want to empower voiceover artists to <strong>work in top-rated studios while traveling to awesome cities</strong> that nourish their creative output and make them connect to the world. You can still have your home-recording studio but what is more exciting than to actually visit the cities you always wanted to go to and still deliver outstanding voiceover performances?</em></p>
