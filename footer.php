	<p><em>studiolist.org is <a href="https://2017.ind.ie/ethical-design/">ethical by design</a>, and it’s <a href="https://github.com/naii/studiolist.org">open-source</a> because it stands for trust and transparency. I want to empower voiceover artists to <strong>work in top-rated studios while traveling to awesome cities</strong> that nourish their creative output and make them connect to the world. You can still have your home-recording studio but what is more exciting than to actually visit the cities you always wanted to go to and still deliver outstanding voiceover performances?</em></p>

	<p>P.S. I have another personal reason to create studiolist.org. In summer 2017, when I had my first voiceover classes with <a href="http://www.voiceofjaybritton.com">Jay Britton</a>, I took my voiceover path more seriously. Before, I was doing <a href="https://vimeo.com/127628838">novice voiceover</a> for a travel startup, with any <a href="https://www.zoom-na.com/products/field-video-recording/field-recording/zoom-h1-handy-recorder">mic at hand</a> wherever I was. Then I learned the <a href="https://www.gravyforthebrain.com">craft of voiceover</a> from the inside out and became part of the friendly VO community. Early 2019, I decided that I don’t want to work being stuck in a home-recording studio. I still want to travel and work while recording great voiceover pieces. <strong>If I cannot work and travel, then voiceover is not worth for my time and effort.</strong> That’s why I’ve been building studiolist.org with small but growing success. Almost 100 studios are on board and I want them all on, especially the less covered areas like Africa, South America and exotic places in Asia and Oceania. You can <a href="https://studiolist.org#volunteer">help me on our mission!</a> <em>— And since I’m bootstrapping studiolist.org (with no 3rd-party capital), I’ve been offering <a href="https://naii.io/#obsession">email copywriting for tech startups</a> that are also bootstrapping. It helps me filling my startup funds.</em></p>
