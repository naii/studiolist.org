		<h1>studiolist.org makes it easy to find voiceover recording studios and book studio time<!-- to book studio time at amazing rates --></h1>

		<p>studiolist.org is a match-maker between top-rated recording studios that have unsold studio time and voiceover artists who want to book this studio time.</p>

		<p>Studio owners list their recording studio so that it’s always booked, and artists find the best studio nearby so that being new in town doesn’t mean being lost and having no idea where to record the next piece.</p>

		<p>In short:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>Studios kill idle times</li>
		<li>Artists find the best studios to record in town</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Recording studios ordered by city</h2>
		<p>Read <a href="#benefits">how studiolist.org benefits you</a>, or log in (soon) to request a price<!-- <a href="/login">request a price</a> -->, get the right contact person, book studio time, see the studio on a nice map or share a review. Below you can also read the background story <a href="#story">why I started studiolist.org</a>.</p>
		
		<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>
		<p>studiolist.org helps voiceover artists <strong>find a recording studio nearby<!-- and book it quick! --></strong>. <!-- In contrast to Google, Facebook and their fellow surveillance capitalism colleagues, I ensure all data is stored securely and safely. Except for the studio name, no personal data is being revealed to the public. That’s why a 3-second registration (full name, email address, password) is required. --></p>

		<h3>Smart use of existing studio infrastructure</h3>

		<p>With studiolist.org, I’m using the existing infrastructure of recording studios. As a voiceover artist you only need to bring your skills and a healthy voice to any place where there are studios to record, no need to bring your own computer and equipment. I think that’s an awesome perspective.</p>

		<ol>
		<li>You book studio time on studiolist.org,</li>
		<li>show up in the studio,</li>
		<li>record and</li>
		<li>send the recorded file to your client or project partner.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>For free for artists</h3>
		<p>With each of your booking I’m charging a commission from the studio owner. The commission is simply included in the price but you don’t pay more, the studio owners accept to receive a little less money from the booking. I hope this is fair for all 3 parties :)</p>

		<h3>The best studios always on top!</h3>
		<p>I’m not accepting payments from studio owners to list their recording studio on top. The only way to get ranked better is by improving their customer service towards the artists who record at their studio. However, in the beginning with no reviews yet, I’ll list the studios alphabetically, from A to Z, so it’s objectively fair.</p>

		<h3>Fast loading time</h3>
		<p>Access studios in milliseconds because the website uses nor images, scripts or special effects. I know you appreciate speed.</p>

		<h3>Updated regularly and immediately</h3>
		<!-- <p>As soon as I find a new studio, I do add it here to the list. <a href="mailto:alexander@naii.io?subject=I opened a studio, please add it to studiolist&body=Hi, my name is _FIRSTNAME_ _LASTNAME_, I opened a new studio or found a studio that is no listed on studiolist. Please add _URL_.">You opened a studio?</a>Do let me know.</p> -->
		<p>As soon as I find a new studio, I do add it here to the list. <strong><a href="/contact/">Contact me</a> if you opened a studio.</strong></p>


		<h3>Honest reviews from real people</h3>
		<p>Please leave a review of what you liked and didn’t like about your studio experience, and what could be improved. <em>As soon as I’ve finished the registration system you can leave a review to a studio.</em> Keep in mind that I will check with the studio whether you actually have recorded in their studio.</p>

		<h3>I’m only human, I make mistakes</h3>
		<!-- <p>You want an up-to-date list and correct information. Ok, me too. If you found a mistake on studiolist, <a href="mailto:alexander@naii.io?subject=I found a mistake on studiolist">please send me what’s wrong</a>.</p> -->

		<!-- <h3>Interviews with the music industry</h3>
		<p>And content-wise, I’m planning to make interviews with musicians and vocal artists and ask the question: „How did you make _NAME OF CREATION_?“</p> -->

		<h2 id="story">This page is run by naii.io</h2>
		<p>Hi, I’m Alexander, founder of naii.io. I’m a solo maker and I run this site. </p>
		<p>I started studiolist.org since I didn’t want to stop traveling only because I switched from being a freelance designer/writer to a voiceover artist. Traveling is in my blood. I enjoy the movement, feeling the global pulse and reading the world’s landscapes. So initially, it was an egoistic reason and I don’t think that’s bad: I just solved a problem I had and I felt I wouldn’t be the only one to benefit from it. So, studiolist.org was born, launched in April 2018 but in February 2019 is when I started taking it seriously by giving myself 120 days to validate the product and connect to recording studios. <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/startupdiarystudiolist/">Here</a> is the whole journey as a public diary on Instagram.</strong></p>

		<h2>Objections</h2>
		<p>Below you find objections I could think of that could hinder you from using studiolist.org.</p>
		<h3>I could use Google (or Google Maps), why use studiolist.org instead?</h3>
		<p>studiolist.org is a dedicated service for voiceover artists. My interest as the founder of the website is to help you get the best recording quality without being tied to a particular location. Voiceover creation and collaboration lives from the exchange of creatives that meet face to face. Yes, the Internet is great for digital collaboration but there’s (currently) no way to imitate the spontaneous, in-person interaction as they happen when you look into each other’s eyes. As a voice actor myself, I’m part of both the acting world and the audio-production industry. I like to have this dual perspective and I enjoy what’s being created in both worlds. So, this is my way to give back to the industry and my way to say „Thank you“.</p>
		<p>studiolist.org is a place of trust, creativity, connection and friendship. I’m not building a walled garden but a community where recording studios and artists get together. Also, studiolist.org is ethical by design. Compare that to tech giant Google who is far from that. I’m a fan of running a „<a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast/043-pieter-levels-of-nomad-list#4214">corner coffee shop internet business</a>“.</p>
		<!-- <p>Also, if you use studiolist, you don’t need to type „recording studio London“, you can can simply type „London“. So easy and fast.</p> -->

		<p><em>If you have other objections, I’d be happy to answer them here publicly as well.</em></p>
